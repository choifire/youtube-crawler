# youtube-crawler

This is not a general crawler, made just for a youtube music crawler based on viewCount
Nothing special
I just integrated a Youtube search example provided by Youtube and youtube-dl, and add some codes

If you wanna apply this for other purpose, you need to modify some parameters and codes.

you need to set three things to use this
1. Youtube Data API Developer Token
    https://console.developers.google.com 
    (and you also turn on Youtube Data API in console)

2. Google-api-python-client
    https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client
    (In my case, i used 'easy_install' command to install this in Mac)

3. Youtube-dl
    https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/
    (In my case, i used 'brew' command to install this in Mac)
